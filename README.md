# HTTPS Request Scala

A compact and modest implementation for making HTTP/HTTP requests in Scala.

## Overview
An object-oriented approach to helping create HTTP/HTTPS requests, and a partial implementation & wrapper of Java's networking package with great help from Scala's Source library. This library simplifies the making of HTTP/HTTPS requests and wraps a number of Java's `HttpURLConnection` class in Scala. 

## Usage
The main purpose of this repository is to provide an implementation for making HTTP/HTTPS requests. Some use cases for this implementation is getting data from an URL or sending data to an API. 
The library strives to make requesting easier and more simplified, and to provide an example on using Java-Scala integration.

## Author Notes
This is more of a wrapper of several Java and Scala classes but it still implements the ability to make HTTP/HTTPS requests. There are a number of things that can improve and get more implementation(s) for.
