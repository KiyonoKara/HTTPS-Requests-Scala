A compact and modest implementation for making HTTP/HTTP requests in Scala.

## Overview
An object-oriented approach to helping create HTTP/HTTPS requests, and a partial implementation & wrapper of Java's networking package with great help from Scala's Source library. This library simplifies the making of HTTP/HTTPS requests and wraps a number of Java's `HttpURLConnection` class in Scala. There are many features and checks being added to make the most optimal HTTP/HTTPS requests in Scala.

## Usage
The main purpose of this repository is to provide an implementation & simplified method for making HTTP/HTTPS requests. Some use cases for this implementation would be retrieving data from a URL or sending data to an API. 
The library strives to make requesting easier and more simplified, and to provide an example on using a Java-Scala approach.

## Author Notes
This repository is more of a wrapper for several Java & Scala classes, but it still implements the ability to make HTTP/HTTPS requests. There are a number of things that can improve and other things surrounding HTTP/HTTPS than can have more implementation(s).
